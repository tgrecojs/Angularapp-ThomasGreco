        <p>When I first began to focus on web development, it was no surprise that I was drawn into responsive design. Before studying development, I worked in graphic design, and became quite skillful at it. In turn, I immediately grew an attraction to the styling aspect of web development, and became destined to master Sass. As a result of this, I have learned to heavily rely on the use of partials, and variables to develop modular .scss. In turn, I can literally reuse this code, and easily change it by manipulating the set variables. When writing Sass, I have become very fond of the Compass CSS framework as it allows me to create projects preconfigured with BootStrap. Moreover, I worked to possess a strong base of knowledge regarding a multitude of grid frameworks, as well as the ability to develop custom frameworks using Susy. 
        Although I still hold an affinity to Sass' power, the vast majority of my time is currently spent pushing myself to JavaScript perfection in both the client and serve sides. Nonetheless, I am confident in my abiity to style rapidly web applications, and definitely believe it is a great skill to possess.
