        <p>
           Throughout the past 14 months, I transformed into a self-starter dedicated to developing responsive web applications. My passion for development played a large role in my ability to perservere through different obstacles and become the developer I am today. Now, I hold the belief that I could succeed in working to accomplish any given goal.As each day continues, I strive towards learning the latest in responsive web development. I have been able to start a career as a freelancer; however, I truly desire to work alongside a team of developers with whom I can make the absolute best of my ability. Therefore, I developed this SPA to help both showcase my ability, as well as my dedication to modern web development. Simply put, I want nothing more than to become the best developer I can possibly be, and I will bring this mindset to work each day. That being said, I am extremely eager to see what the new future has to offer.</p>
