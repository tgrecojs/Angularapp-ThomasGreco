        <p>I developed this Singe Page Application using Angulars ui-router module to create and nest my different views.  Angular was the first model view framework I came in contact to with while learning development and I have been able to witness its steep learning curve as a result of that. Now, I possess enough knowledge to practice rapid development of dynamic web apps.   I developed this SPA over the past 48 hours. It consists of nested views that I have configured using AngularJS’ ui-router. I really enjoy working with Angular; it’s a powerful framework that makes a lot of things possible. I can rely on it to quickly develop a web application for a client. Additionally, I am currently pursuing the opportunity to become a sound, full stack developer; I am especially interested in M.E.A.N. stack development, and I have managed to get a firm grasp on all but MongoDB. Although I am determined I will understand it’s functionality soon, I know I would be deploying M.E.A.N. applications if I had the opportunity to work with others. </p>
